 <h3>Prior Experience</h3>
<p>Before going into what I'd like to do in the future, I'll look back on my past that has prepared me for my future career. I've previously interned in the following positions:</p>
<li>Florida State Capitol</li>
<li>United States House of Representatives</li>
<li><a href="http://www.floridahousedc.org/">Florida House on Capitol Hill</a></li>
<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<p>After I graduate this August, I'd like to stay local in the Central Florida area and work with a representative from Orlando or Gainesville. Eventually, I'd like to return to Washington, D.C. and work on Capitol Hill again. My future dream job is to be White House Press Secretary.</p>
